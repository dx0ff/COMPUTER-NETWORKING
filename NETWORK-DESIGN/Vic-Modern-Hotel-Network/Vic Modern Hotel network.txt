As a part of your end year networking project, you are required to design and implement Vic Modern Hotel network. The hotel has three floors, in the first floor threre are three departments (Reception, Store and Logistics), in the second floor there are three departments (Finance, HR, Sales/Marketing), while in the third floor hosts the IT and Admin. 

Therefore the following are part of the considerations during the design and implementatin

1. There should be three routers connecting each floor (all placed in the server room in IT departments) 
2. All routers should connect to each other using serial DCE cable
3. The network between the routers should be 10.10.10.0/30, 10.10.10.4/30, 10.10.10.8/30
4. Each floor is expected to have one switch (placed in the respective floor)
5. Each floor is expected to have WIFI networks connected to laptops and phones.
6. Each department is expected to have a printer
7. Each department is expected to be in different VLAN with the following details

1st Floor

RECEPITON: VLAN 80, NETWORK of 192.168.8.0/24
STORE: VLAN 70, NETWORK of 192.168.7.0/24
LOGISTICS: VLAN 60, NETWORK of 192.168.6.0/24


2nd Floor
FINANCE: VLAN 50, NETWORK of 192.168.5.0/24
HR: VLAN 40, NETWORK of 192.168.4.0/24
SALES: VLAN 30, NETWORK of 192.168.3.0/24

3rd Floor
ADMIN: VLAN 20, NETWORK of 192.168.2.0/24
IT: VLAN 10, NETWORK of 192.168.1.0/24


8. Use OSPF as the routing protocol to advertise routers
9. All devices in the network are expected to obtain IP address dynamically with their respective router. 
10. All the devices in the network are expected to communicate with each others
11. Configure SSH in all, the routers for remote login
12. In the IT department, add PC called Test-PC TO port fa0/1 to test remote login
13. Configure port security to IT-dept switch to allow only Test-PC to access port fa0/1 (use sticky method ot obtain mac-address with violation mode of shutdown)
